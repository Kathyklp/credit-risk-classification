I’m sorry there are so many files. I am having trouble with Github.
Please use the following files that are the most up-to-date:

I am submitting this again to make sure that I included the correct html link. I was not able to use the website url submission.

I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 
I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:
Requirements
Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets (30 points)   
Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame. (5 points)  completed
Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns. (10 points)  completed
Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split. (15 points)
Create a Logistic Regression Model (30 points)
Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train). (10 points)
Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model. (5 points)
Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
Generate a confusion matrix. (5 points)
Generate a classification report. (5 points)
Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels? (5 points)

Thank you for your time. Kathy
